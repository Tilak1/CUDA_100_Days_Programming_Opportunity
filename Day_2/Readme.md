Day 2 Notes:

**Threads and Blocks:**

  Threads -> Blocks  -> Grid 
  
  Difference between CPU and GPU Threads ? Why should GPU threads make any sense ? 
  
    Note: "Cuda programmers can assume that these GPU threads take very few clock cycles to generate and schedule due to efficient hardware     
    support. This is contrast with traditional CPU threads that typically take thousands of clock cycles to generate and schedule."

**Multiple kernels:**  
  One after another are executed in tandem with the host serial code.
