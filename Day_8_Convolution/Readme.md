In convolution,  Each output data element can be calculated independently of each other, a desirable trait for parallel computing.
On the other hand, there is substantial level of input data sharing among output data elements with somewhat challenging boundary 
conditions. This makes convolution an important use case of sophisticated tiling methods and input data staging methods.
