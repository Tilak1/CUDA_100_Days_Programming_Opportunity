what we just sketched with CUTLASS is kernel fusion, not CUDA Graphs per se.

Kernel Fusion
By using CUTLASS’s Epilogue Visitor Tree we’re literally fusing multiple operations (Conv → GroupNorm → Activation) into one single GPU kernel launch. That collapses three separate dispatches (convolution, normalization, nonlinear) into one, eliminating extra global-memory writes/reads and host–device launch overhead.

CUDA Graphs
CUDA Graphs are a complementary technique: they let you record an entire sequence of kernel launches (and memory ops) once and replay it with zero dispatch overhead. You’d typically

Record: run through your U-Net forward (or train) loop under cudaStreamBeginCapture/cudaStreamEndCapture,

Instantiate the graph,

Launch it repeatedly via cudaGraphLaunch.

Graphs don’t fuse the math inside each kernel—they just fuse the schedule of launches on the host side.

In practice you’d combine both:

Fuse as much as possible into heavyweight kernels (Conv+GN+Act).

Use CUDA Graphs to capture the overall computation graph (all fused kernels, any remaining memsets, etc.) so that subsequent iterations incur almost zero CPU overhead.

This two-pronged strategy (in-kernel fusion + CUDA Graph capture) is what delivers the highest end-to-end throughput.



C++ Skeleton: 

 a minimal C++ example showing how you would combine the fused Conv2D→GN→Activation CUTLASS kernel with a CUDA Graph capture+replay for your inference loop. It assumes you have already implemented launch_conv2d_fprop(...) as in the previous sketch.

cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

// Forward declaration of your fused CUTLASS launch
void launch_conv2d_fprop(
  cutlass::half_t const *A,
  cutlass::half_t const *B,
  float               *C,
  int                  N, Cin, H, W,
  int                  Cout, KH, KW,
  cudaStream_t         stream
);

int main() {
  // 1) Initialize CUDA stream
  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  // 2) Allocate and initialize your buffers (A, B, C)
  //    (Shapes must match your Conv2D arguments)
  cutlass::half_t *d_A, *d_B;
  float           *d_C;
  size_t size_A = sizeof(cutlass::half_t) * /* N*Cin*H*W */;
  size_t size_B = sizeof(cutlass::half_t) * /* Cout*Cin*KH*KW */;
  size_t size_C = sizeof(float)           * /* N*Cout*H_out*W_out */;
  cudaMalloc(&d_A, size_A);
  cudaMalloc(&d_B, size_B);
  cudaMalloc(&d_C, size_C);
  // … upload your host data into d_A, d_B …

  // 3) Warm-up run (to JIT/compile CUTLASS kernels, etc.)
  launch_conv2d_fprop(d_A, d_B, d_C,
                      /*N, Cin, H, W,*/
                      /*Cout, KH, KW,*/
                      stream);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

  // 4) Capture the inference step into a CUDA Graph
  cudaGraph_t        graph;
  cudaGraphExec_t    graphExec;
  cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);

    // Everything here gets recorded exactly once:
    launch_conv2d_fprop(d_A, d_B, d_C,
                        /*N, Cin, H, W,*/
                        /*Cout, KH, KW,*/
                        stream);

  cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph);

  // 5) Instantiate the captured graph
  cudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, nullptr, nullptr, 0);

  // 6) Replay the graph in a tight loop
  const int ITERS = 100;
  for (int i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i) {
    cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, stream);
    // Optionally synchronize here if you need the result each iteration
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);
  }

  // 7) Clean up
  cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec);
  cudaGraphDestroy(graph);
  cudaFree(d_A);
  cudaFree(d_B);
  cudaFree(d_C);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);

  std::cout << "Done " << ITERS << " graph launches.\n";
  return 0;
}
Key points:

We do one warm-up call so the CUTLASS kernels are JIT-compiled and all buffers are “hot.”

Between cudaStreamBeginCapture and cudaStreamEndCapture, only the operations you want replayed go in—here, the single fused kernel launch.

After instantiating the graph, each cudaGraphLaunch replays the entire recorded sequence with zero host dispatch overhead.

You can extend this to include other kernels (e.g. any residual buffers, memsets, or even backward-pass launches) simply by placing them inside the capture region.
