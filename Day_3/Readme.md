# CUDA Thread Block and Grid Configuration

## 📌 One-Dimensional Data

When working with 1D data, correctly defining the number of **blocks** after specifying the number of **threads per block** is crucial.

### 🔢 Computing `numBlocks`

* **Floating-point approach** (conceptual):

  ```cpp
  numBlocks = ceil(length / numThreadsPerBlock);
  ```

  This uses floating-point math but returns a non-integer type.

* ✅ **Integer-friendly trick** (preferred):

  ```cpp
  numBlocks = (length + numThreadsPerBlock - 1) / numThreadsPerBlock;
  ```

  This effectively computes the ceiling without needing floating-point operations.

### ✅ Example

```cpp
int length = 1000;
int numThreadsPerBlock = 256;

int numBlocks = (length + numThreadsPerBlock - 1) / numThreadsPerBlock;  // = 4
```

* `256 * 3 = 768` → Not enough
* `256 * 4 = 1024` → Just enough (overshoot is OK)

### 🛡️ Overshoot Logic

Always guard your kernel code:

```cpp
int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
if (i < length) {
    // Safe to access data[i]
}
```

## 🧭 Multi-Dimensional Data (2D Grids)

For 2D problems, use `dim3` to define thread/block dimensions.

### 📐 Example

```cpp
dim3 threadsPerBlock(32, 32);
dim3 numBlocks((width  + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x,
               (height + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);
```

### 🛡️ Overshoot Logic for 2D

```cpp
unsigned int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
unsigned int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

if (row < height && col < width) {
    // Safe to access data[row][col]
}
```

## 🎯 Concept: Transparent Scalability 

Making the blocks order of execution independent from others can help stay hardware agnostic

## 🎯 Concept: Flexible Resource Assignment & Occupancy

In CUDA, **occupancy** refers to how well the GPU’s resources (like threads and registers) are utilized. Achieving high occupancy means:

* Efficiently scheduling blocks and warps
* Maximizing performance without wasting threads or memory

By tweaking:

* `threadsPerBlock` (e.g., 128 vs 1024)
* Memory access patterns
* Shared memory usage

You can improve occupancy and achieve faster kernel execution.
