# CUDA Thread Block and Grid Configuration

## 📌 One-Dimensional Data

When working with 1D data, correctly defining the number of **blocks** after specifying the number of **threads per block** is crucial.

### 🔢 Computing `numBlocks`

* **Floating-point approach** (conceptual):

  ```cpp
  numBlocks = ceil(length / numThreadsPerBlock);
  ```

  This uses floating-point math but returns a non-integer type.

* ✅ **Integer-friendly trick** (preferred):

  ```cpp
  numBlocks = (length + numThreadsPerBlock - 1) / numThreadsPerBlock;
  ```

  This effectively computes the ceiling without needing floating-point operations.

### ✅ Example

```cpp
int length = 1000;
int numThreadsPerBlock = 256;

int numBlocks = (length + numThreadsPerBlock - 1) / numThreadsPerBlock;  // = 4
```

* `256 * 3 = 768` → Not enough
* `256 * 4 = 1024` → Just enough (overshoot is OK)

### 🛡️ Overshoot Logic

Always guard your kernel code:

```cpp
int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
if (i < length) {
    // Safe to access data[i]
}
```

## 🧭 Multi-Dimensional Data (2D Grids)

For 2D problems, use `dim3` to define thread/block dimensions.

### 📐 Example

```cpp
dim3 threadsPerBlock(32, 32);
dim3 numBlocks((width  + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x,
               (height + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);
```

### 🛡️ Overshoot Logic for 2D

```cpp
unsigned int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
unsigned int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

if (row < height && col < width) {
    // Safe to access data[row][col]
}
```

## 🎯 Concept: Transparent Scalability 

Making the blocks order of execution independent from others can help stay hardware agnostic

## 🎯 Concept: Flexible Resource Assignment & Occupancy

In CUDA, **occupancy** refers to how well the GPU’s resources (like threads and registers) are utilized. Achieving high occupancy means:

* Efficiently scheduling blocks and warps - What are warps ? 
* Maximizing performance without wasting threads or memory

# ⚙️ CUDA: Warps vs Thread Blocks

## 🚀 What is a Warp?

* A **warp** is a group of **32 threads** executed **in lock-step** on a CUDA GPU.
* It is the **basic unit of thread scheduling** on each **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)**.
* Threads in a warp **execute the same instruction at the same time** (SIMD).

> 🔸 **warpSize = 32** (query via `cudaDeviceProp.warpSize`)
> The above  32 threads is only an example

---

## 🧱 What is a Thread Block?

* A **thread block** is a **programmer-defined** group of threads (up to 1024).
* Threads in a block can:

  * Share **`__shared__` memory**
  * Synchronize via `__syncthreads()`
* A block is split into **warps** by the GPU hardware.

## 🔄 How They Relate

```
Thread Block (e.g., 128 threads)
 ├── Warp 0 → threads 0–31
 ├── Warp 1 → threads 32–63
 ├── Warp 2 → threads 64–95
 └── Warp 3 → threads 96–127
```

---

## ⚡ Warp Scheduling & Latency Hiding

* If a warp stalls (e.g., global memory), the SM **quickly switches** to another **ready warp**.
* This **zero-overhead switching** hides latency and keeps the GPU busy.
* Called **latency hiding** or **latency tolerance**.

## 🆚 Warp vs Thread Block

| Feature           | **Thread Block**                    | **Warp**                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Size              | 1–1024 threads                      | 32 threads (fixed)                  |
| Defined By        | Programmer                          | GPU hardware                        |
| Scheduling Unit   | Not scheduled directly              | Scheduled on SM                     |
| Execution         | Threads may not execute in parallel | All threads execute **SIMD**        |
| Shared Memory?    | Yes (`__shared__`)                  | No                                  |
| Sync Allowed?     | Yes (`__syncthreads()`)             | No                                  |
| Divergence Impact | Lower (can sync & recover)          | High (divergent threads serialized) |

---

## ✅ Summary

* A **warp is not a thread block**.
* A block contains **one or more warps**.
* Warps are crucial for understanding **performance** and **execution behavior**.
* Optimize your kernels **with warp-level efficiency in mind**.
